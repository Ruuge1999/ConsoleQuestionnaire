# ConsoleQuestionnaire
A basic program that uses JSON files to show questions and answers to the user.

The user is then able to enter in an answer for each question, which will be highlighted if it was one of the answers.

To use, enter in a JSON file for each argument in the console, or drag a JSON file onto the executable.
